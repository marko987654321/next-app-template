# Pokedex Application Development Steps

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step development process for building the Pokedex application using Next.js, Prisma, and TypeScript. The development is broken down into phases for easier management and testing.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git for version control
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and databases

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation

### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Prisma
- [ ] Set up database (SQLite for development)
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Install additional dependencies (Zod, etc.)

**Commands:**
```bash
npm install prisma @prisma/client
npm install zod
npx prisma init
```

### 1.2 Database Schema Implementation
- [ ] Create `prisma/schema.prisma` based on SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Define all models (Pokemon, Type, Ability, etc.)
- [ ] Add proper relationships and constraints
- [ ] Generate Prisma client

**Commands:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

### 1.3 Project Structure Setup
- [ ] Create folder structure as defined in ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Set up TypeScript types in `/types` directory
- [ ] Create utility functions in `/lib` directory
- [ ] Set up Prisma client configuration

**Folders to create:**
```
lib/
types/
app/api/pokemon/
app/pokemon/
components/Pokemon/
components/Search/
components/UI/
prisma/
```

### 1.4 Basic Configuration
- [ ] Configure TypeScript paths for cleaner imports

- [ ] Add type effectiveness relationships

**Seeding order:**
1. Types (18 Pokemon types)
2. Stats (6 base stats)
3. Abilities (300+ abilities)
4. Pokemon (basic data)
5. Pokemon relationships
6. Type effectiveness chart

### 2.2 API Routes Setup
- [ ] Create `/api/pokemon` route for Pokemon listing
- [ ] Create `/api/pokemon/[id]` route for individual Pokemon
- [ ] Create `/api/types` route for type listing

- [ ] Add proper error handling and validation

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/pokemon` - List Pokemon with pagination
- `GET /api/pokemon/[id]` - Get specific Pokemon
- `GET /api/types` - List all types
- `GET /api/search?q=query` - Search Pokemon

### 2.3 Type Definitions
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for all entities
- [ ] Define API response types
- [ ] Create utility types for forms and components
- [ ] Set up Zod schemas for validation

**Key types to define:**
```typescript
// Pokemon types
interface Pokemon { ... }
interface PokemonType { ... }
interface PokemonStat { ... }

// API types
interface PokemonListResponse { ... }
interface PokemonDetailResponse { ... }
interface SearchResponse { ... }
```
